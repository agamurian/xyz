# Quirky Rig

---

for simplicity to animate

### Its often invisible job

The rigger usualy do the most ninja task of all - he create a skeleton and relations between bones. Later animator will take his work to animate the model. But only animator, the render|game|web engine will take this rig as valid or not. Not always rig considered valid by the game engines, sometimes rig will not even be able to export any animatiion forward to game engine. Thats why the task of reducing bones, creating controls and interface, retreeviewing relations and optimising file for avalible and rich animation is really important and may be the hardest.
